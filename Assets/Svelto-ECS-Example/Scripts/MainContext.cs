		/// Before to start a review of Svelto.ECS terminologies:
		/// - Entity:
		///     it must be a real and concrete entity that you can explain
		///     in terms of game design. The name of each entity should reflect
		///     a specific concept from the game design domain
		/// - Engines (Systems):
		///     Where all the logic lies. Engines operates on EntityViews or EntityStructs
		/// - EntityViews and EntitiyViewStructs:
		///     EntityViews maps Entity Components. The Engines can't
		///     access directly to each entity (as a single set of components), but
		///     through component sets defined by the EntityView.
		///     They act as component filters and expose only the entity components
		///     that the Engine is interested in.
		///     EntityViews are actually defined with the Engine so they
		///     come together with the engine and in the same namespace of the engine.
		///     EntityViewStructs should always be used, while EntityViews as
		///     class use should be considered an exception. 
		/// - Component Interfaces:
		///     Components must be seen as data holders. There may be implementation
		///     exceptions, but the interface must declare a group
		///     of readable and/or writeable data.
		///     In Svelto.ECS components are always interfaces declaring
		///     Setters and Getters of Value Types. DispatchOnSet
		///     and DispatchOnChange must not be seen as events, but
		///     as pushing of data instead of data polling, similar
		///     to the concept of DataBinding.
		/// - Implementors:
		///     Being components interfaces, they must be implemented through
		///     Implementors. The relation Implementors to Components
		///     is not 1:1 so that you can group several
		///     components into fewer implementors. This allows to easily
		///     share data between components. Implementors also act
		///     as bridge between the platform and Svelto.ECS.
		///     Since Components can hold only value types, Implementors
		///     are the objects that can interact directly with the platform
		///     objects, I.E.: RigidBody, Transform and so on.
		///     Note: IComponents must hold only valuetypes for
		///     code design purposes and not optmization purposes.
		///     The reason is that all the logic must lie in the engines
		///     so Components cannot hold references to instances that can
		///     expose functions with logic.
		/// - EntityStructs:
		///     In order to write Data Oriented Cache Friendly and allocation 0 code, Svelto.ECS
		///     also supports EntityStructs. 
		/// - EntityDescriptors:
		///     Gives a way to formalize your Entity in svelto.ECS, it also
		///     defoines the EntityViews, EntityStructs and EntityViewStructs that must be generated once the
		///     Entity is built
